# AOL-Instant-Messenger-Server
This is a fork of an AOL Instant Messenger Server.
The original repository had next to no information about how to use this, build it, or otherwise work on it. This fork will eventually fix that.

# How do I build it.
i dunno yet.

# Are there builds for download?
i dunno yet.

# What language is this in?
i dunno yet.
